Data Cleaning & Preparation

Cleaned and transformed raw customer purchase data using Power Query (Trim, Clean, remove errors, correct data types).

Standardized categorical columns such as gender, region, loyalty status, and promotion usage for consistent analysis.

Created analytical fields including Age Groups, Income Bands, Purchase Frequency Number, Promotion Flag, and Loyalty Rank.

Validated the dataset using Column Quality to ensure no missing or null values.

Removed duplicates and ensured consistent formatting across the dataset.

📌 Data Modeling

Structured the dataset into a fact-style model containing customer demographics, purchase behavior, loyalty attributes, and product-related fields.

Defined clear relationships between analytical columns for segmentation and dashboard filtering.

Applied best practices for model optimization, including correct data types, reduced cardinality, and meaningful hierarchies (e.g., Age Group → Age).

📌 DAX Calculations (Key Measures)

Built core KPIs using DAX including:

Total Revenue

Total Customers

Average Purchase Amount

Average Revenue per Customer

Promo Revenue & Non-Promo Revenue

Promo Revenue %

Average Satisfaction Score

Avg Purchase Frequency Score

Avg Loyalty Rank

Simple CLV (Customer Lifetime Value Proxy)

Used CALCULATE, DIVIDE, AVERAGE, SUM, DISTINCTCOUNT and filter conditions to derive business insights.

📌 Dashboard Development (Power BI)

Designed a three-page Power BI dashboard tailored for business decision-makers:

Executive Summary: Revenue overview with breakdown by region, product category, age group, and loyalty status.

Customer Insights: Segmentation by income band, gender, age group, loyalty tier, satisfaction score, and frequency patterns.

Promotion Analysis: Promo vs non-promo revenue, satisfaction impact, promo usage behavior, and revenue % from promotions.

Used card visuals, clustered bar/column charts, donut charts, matrices, scatter plots, and slicers for interactive insights.

📌 Insights & Recommendations

Discovered that promotions drove significant revenue but slightly reduced satisfaction, suggesting a need for value alignment.

Highlighted regional performance differences to guide targeted marketing and resource allocation.

Showed that age group 25–35 delivered strong purchasing power, ideal for focused campaigns.

📌 Business Impact

Enabled leadership to understand key revenue drivers and high-value customer segments.

Built a dashboard that supports decisions in marketing strategy, product focus, customer retention, and promotional planning.

Delivered a complete, end-to-end analytics workflow (cleaning → modeling → DAX → visualization → insights).
